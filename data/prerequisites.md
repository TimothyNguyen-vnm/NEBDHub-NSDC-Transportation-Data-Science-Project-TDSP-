Here are some key functions I'll frequently encounter:

1. **`head()`**: This function is crucial for getting a quick overview of your dataset. By default, it returns the first five rows, offering a snapshot of your data's structure and values.

2. **`describe()`**: This provides a summary of the statistical characteristics of your dataset. It's particularly useful for gaining insights into the distribution, mean, standard deviation, and range of numerical columns.

3. **`sum()`**: This calculates the total sum of a column or a series of numbers, proving essential for quick calculations and aggregations in data analysis.

4. **`isnull()`**: This helps identify missing or null values in your dataset, allowing for effective data cleaning and preprocessing.

5. **`value_counts()`**: Understanding the frequency of various values in your dataset is a common task in data science. The `value_counts()` function makes this easy by counting the occurrence of each unique value in a column.
