After nearly a month, Iâ€™m thrilled to announce the completion of the NEBDHub & NSDC Transportation Data Science Project (TDSP)! 

This project provided hands-on experience analyzing a dataset of crash incidents from NYC OpenData, covering data from 2012 to 2024, provided by the Police Department (NYPD).

Over the course of the project, I successfully tackled six milestones:
ðŸ”¹ Data Preparation
ðŸ”¹ Data Ethics, Pre-Processing, and Exploration
ðŸ”¹ Time Series Analysis
ðŸ”¹ Geospatial Analysis
ðŸ”¹ Self-Guided Research Question
ðŸ”¹ Virtual Poster Board Creation: Data Storytelling

My analysis examined trends in accidents over time and at different times of the day. After evaluating more than 2 million rows of data, I discovered that accident patterns remained consistent regardless of the impact of COVID-19.

Iâ€™d like to extend my gratitude to the Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub (NEBDHub), National Student Data Corps (NSDC), and the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration for providing this incredible opportunity to learn and grow.

Especially, I want to thank Ms. Emily Rothenberg and Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub for reaching out to me and giving me this amazing opportunity. This has been a great experience for me so far. I have made so many connections and mentorship from you and from the amazing supportive community.
