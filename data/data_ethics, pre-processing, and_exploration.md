**Step 1:** Before I begin assessing our data for missing values, it is important that I understand the ethical implications surrounding data processing. To best prepare myself for this module, I reviewed one or more of the following resources:

Data Science Ethics Flashcard Video Series
What Do I Need to Understand about Data Ethics?
Introduction to Data Cleaning

**TO DO**: Based on the resources above and outside knowledge, what are some potential bias issues related to the availability of data from well-resourced communities as compared to under-resourced communities? How might bias show up in our dataset?

Answer here: The NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset likely contains inherent biases between well-resourced and under-resourced communities. Well-resourced areas typically have better access to police services, more consistent reporting procedures, and superior infrastructure for documenting crashes. In contrast, under-resourced communities may have systematic underreporting due to factors like limited police staffing, distrust of law enforcement, language barriers, or concerns about immigration status. Additionally, differences in physical infrastructure quality and maintenance between these communities could affect both actual crash rates and reporting accuracy, potentially creating a skewed representation of collision patterns across the city.
