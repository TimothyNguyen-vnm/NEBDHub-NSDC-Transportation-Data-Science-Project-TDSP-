## 📌 Key Highlights

- Processed and analyzed **over 2 million crash records** across 12+ years, including the COVID-19 pandemic period.
- Identified **trends in traffic collisions** based on time of day, day of week, contributing factors, and location (boroughs, intersections, etc.).
- Delivered **six analytical milestones**:
  - 🔹 Data Preparation  
  - 🔹 Data Cleaning  
  - 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis  
  - 🔹 Time Series Analysis  
  - 🔹 Geospatial Mapping
